# Interview preparation knowledge vault

This is a knowledge vault with short summaries + links to various topics that you may find helpful, when preparing for technical interview for a position of Software Engineer.

It consists of **Backend**, **Frontend**, **Managemnet** topics and will be mostly helpful for Web - related positions.

You can browse directly from github but I would recommend to use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) for better experience. Text has internal links that is working only in obisidian.
