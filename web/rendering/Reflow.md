When the changes affect document contents or structure, or element position, a reflow (or relayout) happens. These changes are usually triggered by:

- DOM manipulation (element addition, deletion, altering, or changing element order);  
- Contents changes, including text changes in form fields;  
- Calculation or altering of CSS properties;  
- Adding or removing style sheets;  
- Changing the “class” attribute;  
- Browser window manipulation (resizing, scrolling);  
- Pseudo-class activation (:hover).

!Accessing element property in JS triggers **forced reflow**!
