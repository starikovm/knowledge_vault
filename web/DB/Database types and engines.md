1. Hierarchical Databases: Hierarchical databases are best used when data relationships are simple and can be represented in a tree-like structure. They're particularly suited for applications like file systems, telecommunication systems, or representing organizational structures. IBM's Information Management System (IMS) is an example of a hierarchical database management system.

2. Network Databases: Network databases are suitable for applications that require complex many-to-many relationships, often found in systems with interconnected data, such as airline reservation systems or banking systems. Integrated Data Store (IDS) is an example of a network database.

3. Object-Oriented Databases: These databases are most effective when dealing with complex data models with inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. They're useful in scenarios like computer-aided design and manufacturing, multimedia databases, and scientific databases. Examples include PostgreSQL and MongoDB, which support object-oriented features.

4. Relational Databases: Relational databases excel in situations where data integrity and accuracy are critical. They are commonly used for transactional systems and business applications like CRM, ERP, and e-commerce systems. MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server are popular relational database management systems.

5. NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases are best used for handling large volumes of diverse and unstructured data. They are useful in big data and real-time web applications, data analytics, content management systems, and mobile application data management. Examples include Cassandra for wide-column stores, MongoDB for document stores, Redis for key-value stores, and Neo4j for graph databases.
