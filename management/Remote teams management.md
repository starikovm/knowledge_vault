## What do managers of remote teams have to do differently?
-   The biggest difference between managing a remote team versus an in-person team is communication.
-   “Writing synchronously (e.g., chatting via Slack, Basecamp, etc.)” was cited as the primary form of communication in remote teams (45% of survey respondents said this).
-   “Building trust and rapport across the team” is the #1 thing managers should prioritize (33% of remote managers said this), what new managers most frequently overlook (25% of remote managers said this).
-   The second hardest part of a remote manager’s job is “communicating effectively without in-person cues” (15% of remote managers said this).

## How to Communicate Well as a Remote Manager
-   Great remote leaders understand and utilize writing as a tool.
-   Find a structure, a system, for how all communications are handled – or else, it will be indeed too much.
-   Default to over-communication: If you don’t say or explicitly communicate something as a remote manager, your team has absolutely no idea what you’re thinking.
-   Create as many opportunities for you as a remote manager to get in-person cues from your team.

## Process and Tools: How to collaborate effectively when your team is remote
-   Set clear expectations around communication processes such as working hours, requests, sharing ideas, and giving feedback.
-   Specify which messages – and what kind of messages – go into which channel of communication.
-   Honor the quiet and protect your team’s uninterrupted working time.
-   Invest in the right tools for communication, project management, and more.

## How to Build Social Connection in a Remote Team
-   Try incorporating icebreaker questions into your video meetings and one-on-ones that are intriguing, cheeky, humorous – and not stale. https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/08/the-25-best-icebreaker-questions-for-team-building-at-work/
-   Instill a formal onboarding process – 69% of remote managers and employees in our survey said they have a formal onboarding process at their company.
-   Have a dedicated non-work chat channel, whether it’s a #cats channel in Slack, or a place to say “good morning” to everyone once you hop online.
-   Invest in holding company retreats at least once a year, if not several times per year.

## Performance Management in a Remote Team
-   Skip surveillance: Focus on results, and truly trust your employees.
-   Hold consistent one-on-one meetings – it’s recommended to do so once a week, and for 30 minutes to one hour.
-   For performance reviews, incorporate them as lightweight check-ins at multiple points in the year, instead of relying on one, giant review once a year. https://hbr.org/2014/01/stop-basing-pay-on-performance-reviews
